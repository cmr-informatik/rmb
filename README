rmb - raise my blog
-------------------
rmb is a simplistic static blog generator written in go.


Requirements
------------
The preferred compiler is gccgo, version as below or later:

	go version go1.12.2 gccgo (GCC) 9.2.0

Dependencies are bundled in the vendor directory.


Installation
------------
Run:

	git clone github.com/cmr-informatik/rmb
	cd rmb

Then:

	go build -mod=vendor

Or:

	go build -mod=vendor -gccgoflags='-static-libgo'


Quickstart
----------
A few things must be set in a YAML <conf> file:
	
	name            Website name which is used as the index page title
	css-merge-order	CSS files listed in merge/append order where subsequent
	                files are appended to previous files
	out             Output path ($out)
	in              Input path ($in)

Input files are expected to be structured like this: 

	$in/src/*.md    Pages written in markdown w/ YAML header 
	$in/tmp/page    Page template written in go's text/template syntax
	$in/css/*.css   CSS files
	$in/img/*       Image files, copied to $out/img/
	$in/fonts/*     Font files, copied to $out/fonts/

The $in/tmp/page template file must exist.

Generate a new page (index or post):

	rmb <conf> page

Build the website:

	rmb <conf>

Output files are structured like this:

	$out/index.html Html-rendered and minimized site index
	$out/*.html     Html-rendered and minimized posts
	$out/all.css    Merged and minimized CSS file
	$out/img/*      Stuff copied from $in/img/
	$out/fonts/*    Stuff copied from $in/fonts/


Page Template
-------------
Each page exposes several variables for use in the $in/tmp/page template:

	Title           Page title
	Added           Page creation date as 64b Unix timestamp
	Index           True if index page else False
	Body            Minimized HTML page content as a byte slice
	                (use template 'tostring' function to render)

An index page has some additional variables:

	IndexElems	A slice of all other non-index pages as an IndexElem

Each IndexElem provides these variables:

	Title           Page title
	Added           Page creation date as 64b Unix timestamp
	Date            Page creation date in format: 'MMDDYY: '
	Link            Page HTML filepath relative to $out root


Example
-------
A simple example is provided in the example branch:

	git checkout example
	rmb conf
