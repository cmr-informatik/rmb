rmb - raise my blog
-------------------
rmb is a simplistic static blog generator written in go.


Requirements
------------
The preferred compiler is gccgo, version as below or later:

	go version go1.12.2 gccgo (GCC) 9.2.0

Dependencies are bundled in the vendor directory.


Installation
------------
Run:

	git clone github.com/cmr-informatik/rmb
	cd rmb

Then:

	go build -mod=vendor

Or:

	go build -mod=vendor -gccgoflags='-static-libgo'


Quickstart
----------
A few things must be set in a YAML <conf> file:
	
	name            Website name which is used as the index page title
	css-merge-order	CSS files listed in merge/append order where subsequent
	                files are appended to previous files
	out             Output path ($out)
	in              Input path ($in)

Input files are expected to be structured like this: 

	$in/src/*.md    Pages written in markdown w/ YAML header 
	$in/tmp/page    Page template written in go's text/template syntax
	$in/css/*.css   CSS files
	$in/img/*       Image files, copied to $out/img/
	$in/fonts/*     Font files, copied to $out/fonts/

The $in/tmp/page template file must exist.

Generate a new page (index or post):

	rmb <conf> page

Build the website:

	rmb <conf>

Output files are structured like this:

	$out/index.html Html-rendered and minimized site index
	$out/*.html     Html-rendered and minimized posts
	$out/all.css    Merged and minimized CSS file
	$out/img/*      Stuff copied from $in/img/
	$out/fonts/*    Stuff copied from $in/fonts/


Syntax Highlighting
-------------------
rmb uses chroma (via bfchroma) to render syntax highlighting for code-blocks
embedded in a page. All highlighting uses inline HTML and CSS elements - no JS.

A path to a custom YAML <chroma-style> file can be set in the YAML <conf> file:

	chroma-style    Path to YAML file with custom chroma style

If the <chroma-style> entry is missing in the YAML <conf> file, then the chroma
default style is used.

The YAML <chroma-style> file must contain at least a name and a single style:

	name		Style name
	styles		Token and style pairs

A subset of Pygments tokens are recognized using the same syntax as Pygments to
describe color and font rules. See http://pygments.org/docs/styles/ and
http://pygments.org/docs/tokens/.

Recognized tokens:

	keyword
	name
	literal
	string
	number
	operator
	punctuation
	comment
	normal

The normal token is special and defines the default which other styles can
override. The YAML <chroma-style> normal style entry could look like this:

	    normal: "#nnnnnn bg:#nnnnnn"
	             '--+--'    '--+--'
	foreground -----'          |
	background ----------------'


Page Template
-------------
Each page exposes several variables for use in the $in/tmp/page template:

	Title           Page title
	Added           Page creation date as 64b Unix timestamp
	Index           True if index page else False
	Body            Minimized HTML page content as a byte slice
	                (use template 'tostring' function to render)

An index page has some additional variables:

	IndexElems	A slice of all other non-index pages as an IndexElem

Each IndexElem provides these variables:

	Title           Page title
	Added           Page creation date as 64b Unix timestamp
	Date            Page creation date in format: 'MMDDYY: '
	Link            Page HTML filepath relative to $out root


Example
-------
A simple example is provided in the example branch:

	git checkout example
	rmb conf


Licensing
---------
rmb source code is released under the GNU GPL version 3, except for source
files located in the vendor directory. Projects in the vendor directory include
their own licenses separate from rmb.
